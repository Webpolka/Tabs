Tabs.js by WebLegko

Tabs are one of the popular interface elements that allow you to organize content on a web page. 
This element makes the content more convenient for perception. 
Tabs help users switch between different sections of information without overloading the screen with unnecessary data. 
In this article, we will look at how to create tabs using HTML and JavaScript, as well as a little history and application of tabs in web design.

The concept of tabs goes back to the interfaces used in desktop applications. 
The first tabs appeared in the 1980s, when developers began using them to organize information within a single window. 
However, their widespread use in web development only began in the late 1990s, with the advent of HTML and JavaScript technologies.

At that time, web pages were static and contained a lot of information. 
This made them cluttered and difficult to navigate. 
Tabs were one of the first solutions that allowed developers to break down content into multiple categories and make it more user-friendly.

Since then, tabs have become a standard in web design, especially with the spread of AJAX and dynamic content, 
which allowed content to be updated without reloading the page.
